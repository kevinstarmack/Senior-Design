From an academic perspective, my project, From Security Policies to Formal specifications will be a new field of thought of me to explore. This project will be a good mix of many things we have learned throughout our Computer Science studies, both in the classroom and in the workforce. By end of year, we hope to have some automated NLP. This project will give us an opportunity to show-off some of our favorite subjects that we picked up throughout our years at UC, including software engineering, and requirements engineering among many other classes. The most important ideas in computer science that we picked up early in our college careers was that software should be open source as much as possible and made available to anyone that wants to use it. This project will feel like a great way to cap our educational journey at UC because we will get to combine what we learned in the classroom with what we learned on co-op to create a potential deliverable that will provide a service to others that is still being explored.

I believe that many classes that I have taken at UC will end up being beneficial during this project, some of which were Computer Science I (CS1021C), Data Structures (CS2028), Software Engineering (EECE3093C), Requirements Engineering (CS5127), Software Testing and QA (EECE5132), and Technical Writing (ENGL4092). In CSI  I learned many things about basic programming that I still find important today. Software Engineering and Requirements Engineering will both be very important to our planning and definition phases that we will be working on in the next few weeks. Same applies to Software QA. Finally, Technical Writing skills will be important for writeups for our Senior Design class and assignments, as well as for technical documentation of the final product when it is completed.

The bulk of my co-op experience that I consider most valuable was spent at Balluff Inc. as a an After-Sales Technician. While on co-op at Balluff, I was able to learn a lot about project management and reading paper and manuals, which will come in handy for a majority of this project. For starters, while I have the most experience and familiarity in Node.js on the front end, I believe my group will choose to use a different framework or some other tool so we can learn something new throughout the course of this project. The group and the advisor will routinely participate in sprint planning meetings during the planning phase of this project in the near future. Finally, I was fortunate enough to be involved in the deployment process of several projects while on co-op and I believe that knowledge will be helpful towards the end of our project when it comes time to deploy and do final testing before demoing our project.

Iâ€™m very excited to begin work on this project because its a nrew field of knowledge. The company I worked for, Balluff Inc., didnt even know what NLP was. I want to get to learn more about stuff that I'm both intriqgued by as well as challenged by. The field of NLP is certainly fitting on that. My approach to a project is to engross myself in the topic and always think about it. The group plasn to divide up the work evenly, without focusing each individual person on any one part, so we can split up the work  and everyone gets their hands on different parts of the projectn so we all learn something new throughout the process. At the end of the project, my group all hopes to have some new items to add on their resume and much more experience to talk about in an interview.

My expected result for this project is a functional automated Natural Language Processcor, that is designed well and easy to use for the end user. The biggest accomplishment I can see us having at the end of this project is an actual implementation in where I witness the whole process from start to end. We will know we have done a good job if it is nice to use at the end and if it is well received and used by anyone besides us. I find myself driven to make it look very pleasing on the eye and easy to understand so no one is hesitant to use it based on the user experience as well. I will evaluate my own contributions based on how my code stands up to the code of my partners in similar areas of the project, and by that I mean I will evaluate it on how it runs, efficiently speaking, as well as how it looks, readability wise. In the end, I see us having a well designed automated NLP that is easy to understand.
